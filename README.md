# SQL Movie Rental Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **Programming for Data Science with Python** course by Udacity. It involves exploring and analyzing the Sakila DVD Rental database using SQL. The goal is to answer interesting questions about the database and present insights through visualizations created in Python.

## Project Description
The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. In this project, we explore the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, movie rental patterns, payment trends, and store performance. The project submission includes:

- A set of slides presenting the insights derived from SQL queries.
- Visualizations created using Python to support the findings.
- An accompanying text file containing the SQL code for the queries used to derive the insights.

## Contents
- **SQL Project Submission.pdf**: This PDF contains the slides with insights from the database. Each slide includes:
  - A question of interest.
  - The supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
  - A visualization created using Python that answers the question of interest.
- **Queries.txt**: This text file includes the SQL queries used to extract data and answer the questions presented in the slides.

## How to Read the Slides
- **Question of Interest**: Each slide begins with a specific question that was posed to understand different aspects of the DVD rental business.
- **SQL Query**: The SQL query used to retrieve the data needed to answer the question is provided on the slide.
- **Visualization**: Visual representations of the data are created using Python to illustrate the findings and support the insights derived from the SQL query.

## Key Insights

### Film Duration Distribution:
- Analyzed how family-friendly film rentals are distributed across different duration quartiles.
- Found that Animation and Children's categories have a higher count of shorter films, indicating a preference for shorter films among audiences with younger children.

### Monthly Rental Orders by Store:
- Compared the monthly rental orders fulfilled by each store.
- Observed that both stores show similar trends in rental activity, with a significant peak around July 2005.

### Top Paying Customers:
- Identified the top 10 paying customers monthly in 2007.
- Noted similar spending patterns among the top customers, with the highest payments recorded in April, suggesting a shared response to seasonal promotions.

### Customer Payment Fluctuations:
- Analyzed the customers who experienced the greatest monthly fluctuations in payments in 2007.
- Found that Eleanor Hunt had the most substantial fluctuation in monthly payments, with a peak that overshadows other customers.
